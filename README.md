## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- npm (v9 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account (for database)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/babysteps.git
cd babysteps
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
